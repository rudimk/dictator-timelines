This project is a start on that - the idea is to compare the lifetimes of different dictators, using the TimelineJS library, from the fabulous folks at Northwestern University's [Knight Lab](http://knightlab.northwestern.edu/).\r\n\r\nCurrently, this is a basic Github documentation site, with a timeline embedded in it. In a couple weeks, I intend to build a CMS on top of it, which allows you to add different timelines, dictators, and so on.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
